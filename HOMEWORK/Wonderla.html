    <h2>TRAVEL</h2>
    <p>We were taken to Wonderla by <i>Star health team lead</i>.Many of my father's collegues joined us with their family.
    This trip was well arranged by <b>Express holidays</b>.We started to Cochin on friday night around 11.00pm.
    Then we reached Cochin by 7.30 on the morning!<br>
    <i>We went in an A/c bus!</i>

    <h2>ARRANGEMENTS</h2>
   <p> After we reached the place, they alloted us a room for refreshment...They also arranged breakfast for us!
    then we bought some nylon dresses which are preffered to wear there! After buying dresses ,while going back to room we got stuck with rain.<br/>
    Finally we entered into the wonderful Wonderla :)
